Self-taught malware nerd turned aspiring ethical hacker. Cut my teeth on Roblox Lua, VBScript prank viruses, and cursed Batch scripts. OSRS and World of Warcraft enjoyer—yes, I’ve clicked on more rats than I’ve written lines of code. Currently studying cybersecurity, chasing certs (Google Cybersecurity now, OSCP next), and fueled by anime, gacha salt, and questionable sleep cycles. I break things legally—*mostly.*

- 🧠 Self-taught digital gremlin since 2012.  
- 🛠️ Tinkering with malware and hacking tools (ethically, promise).  
- 🛡️ Learning how to stop the bad guys before they CTRL+ALT+RUIN everything.  
- 🎮 Former Roblox dev, former aspiring game dev, current cybersecurity hopeful.  
- 💻 Languages I started with: Batch, VBScript, and other cursed relics.  
- 📚 Currently grinding the Google Cybersecurity Certificate.  
- 🎯 OSCP? Coming for you in 2025.

In 2012, I opened Roblox Studio, wrote some *very* questionable Lua scripts, and never looked back.

Between 2012 and 2015, I got weirdly obsessed with malware. I was the kind of kid who binge-watched sketchy YouTube tutorials on how to make fake antiviruses in batch and “totally real” viruses in VBScript. My favorite pastime? Crafting endless popup windows that just... spawned *more* when you tried to close them. It was chaos. Beautiful, annoying chaos.

At some point, I discovered scam websites and made it a personal mission to try DDoSing them—armed with nothing but a potato PC, dial-up-tier internet, and the unshakable confidence of a preteen with too much free time.

By 2015, I was writing RuneScape-themed text adventures in Batch (yes, really). If you could talk to a banker or pickpocket a “Highwayman.txt,” I was building it.

I breezed through an intro to programming class in high school, dropped out of Georgian College’s Game Design program in 2024, and now I’m all-in on cybersecurity. No more prank scripts—these days I’m studying protocols, doing certs, and working toward my OSCP.
